# SETUP
Run with `docker compose -p aga-congress-2026 up -d`
then run the `configure.sh` script after the containers are up. Do not run the configure script again.

It is highly recommended you change the ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_USERNAME, and ADMIN_PASSWORD variables in the configure script before running, or be sure to change these defaults in the admin panel after setting up the website (it is much harder to change once the site is set up, so it is recommended to do it in the script first)
