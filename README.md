### Site Architecture and Technology Choices

#### WordPress Platform Rationale

* **Why WordPress?**
  * Well-established CMS with a large plugin/theme ecosystem.
  * Non-technical volunteers can edit and manage content easily.
  * Mature support for caching, performance optimization, and security hardening.
  * Easier long-term maintenance than a fully custom site.

#### WordPress Implementation Details

* **Base Image:** Official [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) Docker image
  * Chosen for reliability, security updates, and easy containerization.
* **Theme:** Kadence
  * Selected for its feature-rich free version, strong reviews/popularity, and flexibility.
  * **Alternatives considered:**
    * *Blocksy:* less featureful free version, smaller user base.
    * *Astra:* limited free features, seemed primarily geared toward paid tiers.
    * *Twenty Twenty-Five:* too minimal, not especially popular.
* **Plugins:**
  * **Minimal plugin philosophy:**
    The Go Congress website's functionality requirements are modest. In many WordPress installations, excessive or redundant plugins increase maintenance overhead and expand the potential surface area for security or compatibility issues. To avoid this, we aim to keep the plugin set minimal and focused on core needs.
  * **Plugins being used:**
    * **Stackable - Gutenberg Blocks:** Adds layout blocks, patterns, and prebuilt designs to simplify content creation.
    * **WP Super Cache:** Provides server-side page caching for faster load times.
    * **Performance Lab:** Adds client-side performance optimizations from the WordPress core team.
